### CSS Terms
- in html and image is known as replace element, which means the image does not leave in the element but rather it place


<!-- this is added to the html of an image tag to tell the browser how to load the image  -->
- loading = ["eager", "lazy"]
<!-- Eager is used to make the browser load the image before the user get to the image -->
<!-- Lazy is used to display the image only when it close to the viewport -->
- objectFit

<!-- by default images are inline element which means it always has a small space below the image -->

## object-position
- The object-position CSS property specifies the alignment of the selected replaced element's contents within the element's box. Areas of the box which aren't covered by the replaced element's object will show the element's background.

it also use to adjust how the replaced element's object's intrinsic size (that is, its natural size) is adjusted to fit within the element's box using the object-fit property.
